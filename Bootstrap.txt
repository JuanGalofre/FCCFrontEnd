  class="container-fluid" in a div
    Containers are the basic layout element in bootstrap, and are required to use the 12 spaces system of bootstrap. 
  There are 3 basic containters:
    .container -> Sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
    .container-fluid -> width: 100 % at all breakpoints
    .container-{breakpoint} -> width: 100% until the specified breakpoint

  class="img-responsive" in an image : To make it adopt the size of the website i guess
  class="text-center" to a h2 in order to center it. 
  class="btn" and class="btn-default" to give buttons a default bootstrap style, Way cleaner.
  Also class="btn-block" gives the button the 100% width. Also it will push other stuff down.
  class="btn-default" will put the main color of my app in the button. It replaces the btn-default.
  So we will get something like class="btn btn-primary btn-block"
  A different color will be handled if we put the class="btn-info". It is for optional actions
  Finally, class="btn-danger" will signal users that the button performs a destructive actions.
  Bootstrap has many predefined colors for buttons
